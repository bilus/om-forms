# om-forms

A Clojurescript library that lets you build beautiful forms with Om and Bootstrap 3 and (optionally) Font Awesome. The focus is on quickly building forms rather than making supporting every Bootstrap feature. 

I deliberately limit the functionality to the essentials. If you think something useful is missing though, please let me know. The library does not use Bootstrap JavaScript.  

You can safely use this library in your project. It has been used in a large production project and its interface isn't likely to change.

## Usage

### Getting started

Your dependencies in project.clj should roughly look like this:

```clojure
:dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.7.0-RC1"]
               [org.clojure/clojurescript "0.0-3308"]
               [org.omcljs/om "0.8.8"]
               [sablono "0.3.4"]
               [om-forms "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]
               ...]
```

Remember to link to bootstrap css from your html page, e.g.:

```html
<link href="https://netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.1.1/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet"/>
```

To use Font Awesome icons to use features such as progress spinner, warning icons etc., link to it as well:

```html
<link href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.3.0/css/font-awesome.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
```


Minimal requires:

```clojure
(ns hello-world.core
  (:require [om-forms.core :include-macros true :as forms]
            [om.core :as om]
            [sablono.core :include-macros true :as sablono]))
```

### Quick tutorial

#### Hello, world!

Here's how you create an Om component with a form with just one text field and a button:

```clojure
(defn simple-view
  [data _owner]
  (om/component
    (sablono/html
      (f/form
        {}
        (f/text "Your name" "Type your name here" data [:name])
        (f/form-buttons
           (f/button "Submit" #(js/alert (:name @data))))))))
```

Note that `form` returns a data structure compatible with [sablono](https://github.com/r0man/sablono) which we then compile into a node using `sablono/html` above.

#### Data binding

### Prettying it up

#### Changing orientation

To change the orientation use `with-options`:

```clojure
(f/with-options {:form {:horizontal true}}
    (f/form
     {}
     (f/text "Your name" "Type your name here" data [:name])
     (f/form-buttons
       (f/button "Submit" #(js/alert (:name @data))))))
```

#### Wrapping in panel

To wrap the form in a panel, use `panel`:

```clojure
(f/panel
    "Hello, world"
    {}
    (f/form
      {}
      (f/text "Your name" "Type your name here" data [:name])
      (f/form-buttons
        (f/button "Submit" #(js/alert (:name @data))))))
```

#### Button types

Finally, let's take make the button clearly a primary one and add a cancel button and, just for the fun of it, a checkbox that toggles the orientation:

```clojure
(f/form
  {}
  (f/text "Your name" "Type your name here" data [:name])
  (f/form-buttons
    (f/button-primary "Submit" #(js/alert (:name @data)))
    (f/button-default "Cancel" #(js/alert "Cancel!")))
  (f/checkbox "Horizontal form" data [:orientation-horizontal]))
```
